html:
1. started from scratch by seeting up the doctype and head;
2. then started to develop the body of website with 5 major sections: home, about, portfolio, contact form and footer;
3. specific class and id are assigned for sections, div, headers, images, lists, labels, and forms;
4. images are originally made by myself and were sourced correctly with descriptive altributes;
5. some comments are made to separate the sections to know what is each section about.

css:
1. style major parts of website: body, container, section and form;
2. specific styling the sections of homepage, about, portfolio, contact form and footer;
3. for each section, unique styling for parts in side of each section for proper display, color, and functions.
